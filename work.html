    <p> What are my proudest work accomplishment? Last summer I worked at PayPal, here's what I did: 
        Adopted primary customer segments into targeted outbound email marketing campaign
        positioning product to user types, resulting in 802k accounts attributed to crypto feature.
        Innovated in-app digital experience and bonus rewards program considering Venmo and
        PayPal credit card competitor analyses and revolving credit expansion strategy, creating a
        forecasted P&L with 6% program ROA and $200k+ 5-year cryptocurrency halo.
        Designed go-to-market strategy and pricing for subscription management and cryptocurrency
        features upon card launch implementing evergreen marketing, projecting 8% TPV lift.

    <p> I'm also super passionate about working within the community and helping local nonprofits with their 
        digital marketing. Hence, this led me to the Google CLP program where I have: 
        Researched 150+ non-profits to develop database for application outreach and acceptance
        into CLP Non-Profit Academy, improving 6 non-profits digital marketing using Google tools.
        Learned fundamentals of Google tools and digital inclusion, resulting in over 14+ hours of
        training including mentorship from Googlers and certifications in Google Ads and Analytics.
        Started workshops for non-profits utilizing Grow with Google materials, anticipating over 90%
        increase in online presence including Google Knowledge Panel verification for organizations.
